    <main>
        <p> Welcome to my page! My name is Paul Decker and I'm currently taking the Interactive Media Design program at Alognquin College, some of my hobbies would include video gaming, singing, creating humorous YouTube edits also known as <abbr=YouTube_Poops>YTPs</abbr>, and walking my dog; Some of my favorite foods of all time would have to be <em> Hawaiian Pizza, Chorizo Burritos, Chicken Shawarma, etc. </em> I also have a passion for Broadcasting on the Radio, I previously took the "Broadcasting and Radio Podcasting" program here at Algonquin College and I enjoyed it quiet a bit! I'm hoping I can learn some skills that can help support my knowledge of Broadcasting by letting me create some cool illustrations, better websites to market myself, etc. Oh yeah my Birthday is on February <sup> 14th </sup> 2003 so that's pretty cool isn't it?
